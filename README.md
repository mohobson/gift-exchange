Introduction to the Web App
</summary>

This web app is designed to provide a quick and simple way to set up a Secret Santa style gift exchange for groups of any size. Plug in the names and emails of each participant then submit the form and participants will receive
an anonymous email notifying them who to get a gift for. 

An optional feature of the app is that you can specify couples within the group. This will add a rule to the algorithm such that these names will not be assigned to each other.

Enjoy this ad-free app at no charge. The site is meant to compliment my professional portfolio so I currently have no intention of monetizing it or collecting user data.
